State-vector 64 byte, depth reached 66, errors: 0
     194 states, stored
     303 states, matched
     497 transitions (= stored+matched)
       0 atomic steps
hash conflicts: 0 (resolved)

Stats on memory usage (in Megabytes):
0.014 	equivalent memory usage for states (stored*(State-vector + overhead))
0.304 	actual memory usage for states (unsuccessful compression: 2173.31%)
	State-vector as stored = 1557 byte + 8 byte overhead
2.097 	memory used for hash table (-w19)
0.320 	memory used for DFS stack (-m10000)
0.123 	other (proc and chan stacks)
0.099 	memory lost to fragmentation
2.622 	total actual memory usage
