<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After launching client
aplication we need to choose if we will be working in online mode or
in offline mode. For work in online or offline mode is necessary to
log in by active login and password. When we are going to wok in
online mode we need to specify server address and port. Next we must
choose if we want to download data from server or send data to server
(if there were changes in offline mode). For users without account
there is an option to register after pressing register button.</P>

actual date. Actual date is displayed in lower right corner of the
aplication. Weekly view is divided to 7 days and 24 hours. By every
hour we can see how many events are scheduled at concrete hour. In
monthly view we see single weeks and days in them. In every day
number of events that are scheduled is shown.</P>
